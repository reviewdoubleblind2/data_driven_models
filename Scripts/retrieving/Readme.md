Here you can find two scripts for retrieving the best model:
* **retrieve_best_CNN_RNN.py:** you can use this script for obtaining the best model after the process of hyper-tuning  for CNN and RNN with Optuna. 
* **retrieve_best_RF.py :** you can use this script for obtaining the best model after the process of hyper-tuning  for Rando forest with Optuna.
